# falcon_boilerplate

- Easy modularization and maintenance of code
- Creation of route is done through folder structure and files within
  the folder are register has resource handler no extra code editing
  needed for route creation and resource registration
- Their can be specific version for resource at a time
  for eg. we can have version 1 for one resource and version 2
  for other resource
- If want to remove specific api endpoint or specific version
  related code just removing the folder would be suffice
- Logging and Validation middleware is added for generic use cases
